# Attributes

**Encrypt**: The key can be used for encryption, meaning it can transform plaintext into ciphertext.

**Decrypt**: The key can be used for decryption, allowing it to transform ciphertext back into plaintext.

**Sign**: The key can be used for creating digital signatures.

**Verify**: The key can be used for verifying digital signatures.

**Wrap**: The key can be used to wrap (encrypt) other keys for secure transmission or storage.

**Unwrap**: The key can be used to unwrap (decrypt) encrypted keys.

**Derive**: The key can be used to derive other keys.

**BIP32**: The key can be used for hierarchical deterministic key derivation (BIP32).

**Extractable**: The key can be extracted from the device or context where it's stored.

**Modifiable**: The key can be modified once it's generated.

**Destroyable**: The key can be intentionally destroyed (deleted).

**Sensitive**: The key contains sensitive information and is treated as confidential.

**Copyable**: The key can be copied or duplicated.
