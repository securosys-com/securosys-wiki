# Key Attestation

## 1. Generate Key Attestation


POST: /v1/key/keyAttestation

**Description**: Generate key attestation files by key label

Replace `<keyname>` and `password`. The password is optional and can be deleted completely.

```js
{
  "label": "<keyname>",
  "password": [ "R","E","P","L","A","C","E" ]
}
```

## 2. Verify Key Attestation (Optional)

:::tip Tip

The the previosly downloaded attestation zip-file and the CSR are sent to the QTSP. Before issuance of the certificate the QTSP follows the validation steps indicated in the README_PrimusHSM_AuditAndAttestation_AN-E01.md contained in the zip-file.
Note: Before sending the request to the QTSP we recommend that the certificate requester is performing the validation checks himself to assure the correctness.

:::

For highest assurance and to guarantee that all these checks can be conducted independently from any Securosys software or tools, weâ€™ll use the OpenSSL software library to perform the verifications.

The Primus Root certificate `hsm_rsa_root.crt` can be downloaded under: [PrimusHSM Root Certificate for Key-Attestation](https://support.securosys.com/external/knowledge-base/article/147)

```
openssl verify -CAfile hsm_rsa_root.crt -untrusted PrimusHSM_Attestation.crt PrimusHSM_Attestation.crt
```
**Response:**

PrimusHSM_Attestation.crt: OK

```
openssl dgst -verify PrimusHSM_Attestation_PublicKey.pem -sha256 -signature CsrRSAKey.sig CsrRSAKey.xml
```
**Response:** 

Verified OK

```
openssl req -in CsrRSAKey.csr -noout -pubkey -out SigningKeyCsrPubKey.pem
```

```
openssl asn1parse -noout -in SigningKeyCsrPubKey.pem -out SigningKeyCsrPubKey.der
```

```
grep public_key CsrRSAKey.xml | sed -e 's,[^>]*>,,' -e's,<.*,,' | base64 -d > SigningKeyAttestationFilePubKey.der
```

```
cmp SigningKeyCsrPubKey.der SigningKeyAttestationFilePubKey.der && echo Verified OK
```
**Response**
Verified OK
